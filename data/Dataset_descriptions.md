# Leukemia  
Study (Golub et al.): https://www.broadinstitute.org/mpr/publications/projects/Leukemia/Golub_et_al_1999.pdf

Two classes:  
1. acute myeloid leukemia (AML): 25 samples  
2. acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL): 47 samples  

```Total number of samples: 72```  
```Total number of genes: 5147```

# (2) Small round blue cell tumors (SRBCT)  
Study (Khan et al.): http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/microarray/nm0601_673.pdf

SRBCTs are 4 different childhood tumors “so named because of their similar appearance on routine histology, which makes correct clinical diagnosis extremely challenging. However, accurate diagnosis is essential because the treatment options, responses to therapy and prognoses vary widely depending on the diagnosis.”

Four classes:
1. Ewing's sarcoma (EWS): 29 samples
2. Burkitt's lymphoma (BL): 11 samples
3. neuroblastoma (NB): 18 samples
4. rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS): 25 samples

```Total number of samples: 83```
```Total number of genes: 2308```

# (3) Prostate cancer
Study (Singh et al.): http://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/abstract/S1535-6108(02)00030-2

Two classes:
1. normal tissue: 50 samples
2. prostate tumor: 52 samples

```Total number of samples: 102```
```Total number of genes: 12533```

# (4) Lung cancer
Study (Bhattacharjee et al.): http://www.pnas.org/content/98/24/13790.long

Five classes (4 tumors and normal):
1. adenocarcinoma (AD): 139 samples 
2. normal lung (NL): 17 samples 
3. small cell lung cancer (SMCL): 6 samples 
4. squamous cell carcinoma (SQ): 21 samples 
5. pulmonary carcinoid (COID): 20 samples 

```Total number of genes: 12600```
```Total number of samples: 203```

# (5) Leukemia ALL before and after treatment
Study (Cheok et al.): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE412

Two classes:
1. before treatment: 50 samples 
2. after treatment: 60 samples 

```Total number of genes: 8280```
```Total number of samples: 110```

# (6) Renal Cell Carcinoma
Study (Boer et al.): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE3

Two classes:
1. normal tissue: 90 samples 
2. tumore tissue: 81 samples 

```Total number of genes: 36864```
```Total number of samples: 171```
